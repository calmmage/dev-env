Idea: a tool for upgrading my old repos from old templates

a) add vulture
b) add black
c) update yaml test setup
d) upgrade dockerfile?
e) upgrade pyproject.toml to a new format
f) install pre-commit

g) add a script to run all of the above

bonus: upgrade from my old libraries to new ones - calmlib, botspot etc.
