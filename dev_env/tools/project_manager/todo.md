- guess the project 
  - idea: look at the pwd.
  - idea 2: ask the user.
    - if pwd is a project / within a project = default is it
    - if pwd is not a project / within a project = default is the default project

- use generic repo discovery from old code
- move shared code from @project-arranger to lib
