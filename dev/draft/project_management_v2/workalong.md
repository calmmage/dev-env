    - [x] make cached all properties - last modified

    -  [ ] projects that are to be deleted (ignored but present on disk) - move to 'to_remove' folder
  - debug / research tools
    - a) view project sizes
      - notice big ignored projects
      - notice small non-ignored projects (except recent) 
    - b) view project dates

- [x] fix 'ignore' and 'ignored' issue

- [ ] Better project sorting
  - [ ] Anomaly decetion - analysis / research tools
  - [ ] automatic sorting: 
    - sticky groups (don't change groups for no reason)
      - if recently modified -> stays in 'actual' even if not hardcoded
    - by date -> 
      - if created this month - stays in experiments
      - if before
        - if modified this month -> actual
        - if before
          - if big -> archive
          - if not -> ignore (to_remove)
