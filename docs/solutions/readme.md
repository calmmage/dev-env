# Solutions

A lot of the functions have a lot of different solutions

This folder contains descriptions of the scenarios I use for solving those functions

Also alternatives
And possible future replacements / improvements to explore

Example:
Killing processes.
- regular kill
- killing through raycast
- asking github cli copilot
- fkill
